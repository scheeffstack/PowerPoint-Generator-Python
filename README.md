## Setup the Secret Key and OpenAI Key 

The application uses a secret key for session management and an OpenAI key for the GPT-3.5 Turbo API.
These keys are defined as environment variables, and you can easily set them up using the provided .env.example file.

1. Locate the file named .env.example in the project directory.
2. Copy the contents of .env.example into a new file named .env.
3. Replace the placeholder values with your actual keys:
   
```
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_key
PEXELS_API_KEY=your_pexels_key
```

Here's a brief description of each key and how to obtain them:

**SECRET_KEY**: 🔐This is used for web application security such as session management. You can create your own secure, random string for this.

**OPENAI_KEY**: 🤖This is required to access the OPENAI API. Although there's a limitation with the free version, it's sufficient for trying out this web application on your local machine. You can obtain this key by creating an account on the https://platform.openai.com.

**PEXELS_API_KEY**: 🏞️ This key is used for the free image search API provided by Pexels. It's very useful for adding creative images to your presentations. You can get this key by creating a free account on the https://www.pexels.com/api
After registering, the API key is automatically generated for you.
